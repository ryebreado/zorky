# Zorky

Zorky was created during the summer of 2023 as a summer project to help us learn Python, CSS, and HTML. 

The original plan was to create a game similar to [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork), with the ability to type in commands, and fight monsters. It eventually evolved to become something more inspired off of DND and turn based games.

## What We Learned

* **Python** - We learned basic data structures such as lists and dictionaries. We also used classes with inheritence.
* **HTML** and **CSS** - We learned the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as how to combine the two skills to create an asthetic webpage. We used mainly flexboxes to structure our webpage. 
* **Flask** - We used the flask webserver framework, incuding Jinja templates to generate HTML. 
* **HTTP** - learned basics of HTTP. Our server uses POST and GET, as well as using cookies to store data such as username.
